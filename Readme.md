A small application to generate a skeleton project based on
autotools.

I've created this when I was learning the GNU autotools tools. I was
so intimidated by those that I've writed this so I could add new
things while learning and not forgeting the old ones.

Now I use this for each new project.

It has some basic functionality commented out that you may activate
just uncommenting it and adapting to your needs.

Unfortunately, as the tools change this little tool becomes more and
more obsolete. (But I use it anyway!)
